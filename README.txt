Joystick Control for Cocos2d Objective-C (in Swift)
===================================================

This is a simple Joystick used for CocosBuilder and Cocos2d ObjC!

Clone to desktop and open file under CocosBuilder.
Check out MainScene.swift to check how things were implemented.

I don’t have any “tutorials” but I figure the code is simple enough
for anyone needing to add a “joystick” function to their game or app.

Where to download CocosBuilder? Follow these instructions:

git clone https://github.com/oxeron/cocosbuilder
cd CocosBuilder
git submodule update --init --recursive

Open up the Xcode project file in ./cocosbuilder/CocosBuilder
Do not change any recommended settings, just click “Build” and move the
app into your applications folder.

Enjoy!

===================================================

It has been updated for use with Xcode 7 and iOS9.
